# Map Levels
Mark your footprint using these simple apps

US: https://joanwolk.github.io/us-level/us.html

Europe: https://joanwolk.github.io/us-level/eu.html

> This is a fork to re-point the US map, with heavier weights on having lived somewhere and combining the "stopped here" and "passed here" into a single "transited here" level. 
> I recommend referring to the [original project](https://github.com/tenpages/us-level/) and to file [issues](https://github.com/tenpages/us-level/issues) or fix them with [pull requests](https://github.com/tenpages/us-level/pulls).

## How to

Tap and mark countries, states or terretories you've been to. Tap "Save" to save it as image and share your progress.

## Features

* Added Espanol version with help from @jesrivera95
> Could use help to create different language versions. PR please!
* Automatically store your progess locally so remember to come back and update your progress!
* Tap background to randomly change bg color
* New "Want to be here" level (0 pts but different color)
* Change languages in the legend

## Diary

There is a short post related to this project in 
[tenpage's blog](https://tenpages.github.io/dev/2022/10/24/level/).

## Disclaimer

Countries potrayed in the maps are highly abstracted. Only major parts of countries are illustrated. For the European version, only sovereign countries with recognition from overwhelming majority of other countries in the world (as of 2022-10-25) are included.

Definitions of levels are deliberately not specified. Please use at your own discretion. I'd only suggest "higher the points, higher the 'involvements' you have for that place".

Please feel free to create other versions using this code, so long as they are released under the same license. I do not have future plans on creating new versions, as my knowledge in other regions might not be sufficient for me to do so.

## Fonts and settings

`html/slice.woff` is built from Noto Sans by Google Fonts. 

`generate-font-slice.js` contains legacy files and configs from `china-ex` repository.
